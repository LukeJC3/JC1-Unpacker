# JC1 Unpacker
Tool to extract the archives of Just Cause 1 and its demo
I manually went through the archives and added missing file paths that weren't there in the original. I also merged in the filelist that came with the JC1 Demo

Worry not, there is an already built version [here](https://github.com/LukeJC3/JC1-Unpacker/releases)

| Game   | Known files   | Known%   |
|---      |---    |---    |
| Just Cause | 5423/7000 | 77.47%
| Just Cause Demo | 3650/3650 | 100%
